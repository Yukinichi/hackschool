# Hackschool Part 1 - Intro to Frontend

## Intro
Welcome to the first session of Hackschool! The idea behind this series is that you'll learn a lot about web development while making a meme generator that others can use. The slides are linked here as well, so follow along with those if you like!

## What even is web development?
Making websites! Websites can vary hugely in form and function. These can range from static blogs to crazy animations to a repository for all information on the internet. 

The infrastructure for using these websites is called the World Wide Web. Websites are served to our computers by...well, servers, which each are assigned individual addresses called Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Each server will have different routes (everything after the .com slash) for different content, depending on what the developer has included. 

Web development is commonly split into two different categories: 
 1. Front-end development: everything that the user sees and interacts with, ranging from the look and feel of the website to processing user input to be sent to the server.
 2. Back-end development: everything the server does, including processing requests from the client with different routes, and processing incoming data from the user (usually to be stored in a database).

We'll be focusing on the basics front-end development today, so be sure to come back for part 2, when we'll talk more about backend!
